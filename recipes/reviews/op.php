<b>The Other Place</b> - <a href="http://theotherplace.com/locations/" target="new">Multiple Locations</a>.

<p>Pizza is always one of my favorite foods, and I have been able to find a good one both in the town I grew up in Cedar Falls, Iowa and where I live today in Kansas City, Missouri.  Founded in Cedar Falls on the campus of the University of Northern Iowa in the 1970's, the Other Place has grown to 10 different locations in Iowa and Kansas.  Known for their pizza, the Other Place consistently churns out great food and is always a fun environment to watch a sporting event, especially if it is one of the local teams!  As a family owned pizzeria, the Other Place prides themselves on a made-from-scratch menu, great customer service, and a one-of-a-kind game day presentation.

<p>One of my favorite types of pizza, and one that they are well known for by regulars, is the Taco Pizza.  Covered in lots of toppings and served with a very tasty taco sauce, this one is sure to be a hit!  I also am a fan of their original pizza, especially if it has pepperoni on it!

<p>To learn more about the Other Place, visit <a href="http://theotherplace.com/" target="new"> their website</a> or on Twitter at <a href="https://www.twitter.com/TheOtherPlaceKC" target="new">TheOtherPlaceKC</a>.
