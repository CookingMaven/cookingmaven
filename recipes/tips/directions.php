<p>A beginning cook should always follow a recipe when trying to make a dish.  When you have more experience, though, substituting to your liking can be a great way to find a perfect recipe.  Although people sometimes feel the recipes, or any other direction for that matter, are optional and are not needed, in fact they are very useful.  Professional chefs use recipes when learning a new recipe, or even when a recipe seems not to be correct.
<p>
With most people, the main problem in reading a recipe, is that they do not know how.  <a href="recipe.php">Click Here</a> to see a sample recipe and how to read it.
